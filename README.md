# Marquee Night

A TV-studio trivia board for game nights. The big screen shows a 6 × 5 board; the host runs everything from their phone, which also shows the answers. Teams pick tiles, steal on wrong answers, hit hidden bonus tiles, and finish with a wagered final round. Players can sign in on their own phones, get shuffled onto teams, and climb a season leaderboard that ranks people, not teams.

## Running it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000
```

| Route | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | Setup on the laptop: pick a saved game, the sample, or a JSON file; enter teams |
| `/tv` | The big screen (1920×1080, scaled to fit). Move the mouse for laptop controls |
| `/host` | The host's phone remote (type the room code from the TV) |
| `/play` | A player's phone: sign in, join with the QR code, follow your team |
| `/leaderboard` | Season power rankings |
| `/editor` | Write games; saved in this browser, exported as JSON |

### Realtime (phone ↔ TV)

Create `.env.local` with your Supabase project's API settings:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
```

Only Realtime **broadcast** is used (no tables), so the free tier is plenty. Make sure public Realtime channels are allowed in the project settings. Without the keys the app falls back to linking tabs in the same browser, which is handy for development but can't reach a phone.

### Accounts and the season leaderboard (optional)

Without these the app is a plain team game: the lobby QR code goes to the host remote, as before.

1. Create a [Clerk](https://clerk.com) application and add its keys to `.env.local`:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=...
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY=...
   ```
2. Run [`supabase/migrations/20261008000000_season_leaderboard.sql`](./supabase/migrations/20261008000000_season_leaderboard.sql) in the Supabase SQL editor.
3. Add the Supabase **service role** key (server-only; never `NEXT_PUBLIC_`):
   ```
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...
   ```

On game night, sign in on the setup screen before opening the lobby; that makes it a ranked night with you as host of record. Players scan the QR code, sign in, and appear on a team; the host taps **Shuffle teams** (or taps a player to move them). When the winner screen shows, the TV saves the results. Only players who joined from their own signed-in phone earn points, and the server computes the points itself.

The leaderboard tables have row-level security on with no policies, so the public anon key used for Realtime can't read or write them; all access goes through the API routes, which check the Clerk session.

The QR code points at whatever address the TV page was opened with, so for a real phone during development open the laptop by its LAN IP (or use the deployed URL).

### Laptop shortcuts on `/tv`

`C` correct · `W` wrong · `R` reveal · `Enter` continue · `P` pause/start timer · `S` skip timer · `Z` undo · `M` mute · `F` fullscreen · `H` pin the controls

## Rules (as implemented)

- Correct: picker gains the tile value. Wrong: picker loses it (scores can go negative), and the next team gets one **risk-free** steal. The turn always passes to the next team in order.
- Bonus tiles (up to 2): the picker wagers 0 to their score, or up to 500 if their score is lower. No steal.
- Final round: teams with a positive score wager secretly on the host's phone; answers are revealed lowest score first.
- The host can edit any score and undo the last action at any time. Undo never removes a player who joined.
- **Streaks:** 3 correct answers in a row puts a 🔥 on the team; every 5 in a row pays a +100 bonus. A wrong answer (including a missed steal) resets it. Score edits don't touch it.
- **Deep cuts:** the last row of every category looks and sounds different (dark red tiles, a drone sting). Write those to be genuinely hard.
- **Season points**, per player: the team's placement points (1st 12 · 2nd 9 · 3rd 7 · 4th 5 · 5th 4 · 6th 3, ties share the better place) plus 1 per correct answer the team made, final included.

### Question types

Set per tile in the editor (`type` in the JSON; omit it for Normal). Types are hidden until the tile is picked.

| Type | JSON | Rules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Normal | — | Answer the question |
| Multiple choice | `"multipleChoice"`, `options`: 2–6 choices, `answer`: one of them | Stealable |
| True / False | `"trueFalse"`, `answer`: `"True"` or `"False"` | No steal |
| Picture / Audio / Video | `"picture"` / `"audio"` / `"video"`, plus matching `media` | Normal rules |
| Closest wins | `"closest"`, `target`: a number (`answer` optional) | Every team guesses; the closest (ties too) score the value; nobody loses points. Can't be a bonus tile |
| Order it | `"order"`, `options`: 4 items in the correct order | The TV shuffles them and labels A–D; `question` and `answer` are optional |
| Connection | `"connection"`, `options`: 4 clues, `answer` | `question` is optional |
| Wager | `"wager"` | The picker risks 0 to their score (or 500) before seeing the question. No steal. Can't also be a bonus tile |

The answer is never rendered on the TV until it's revealed: the display only ever receives a `PublicView`, which has no answer field until then.

## Game files

A game is one JSON file (format in the product brief). See [`public/sample-game.json`](./public/sample-game.json). Images, audio and video are embedded as `data:` URIs so a game works offline; the editor compresses images to about 500 KB and caps audio at 1.5 MB and video at 4 MB (link bigger clips by URL).

## Development

```bash
npm test           # engine, validation and sound-trigger tests (Vitest)
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

Code map:

- `src/lib/game/` — the rules engine (pure reducer), TV/host/player view projections, JSON validation, question types, ranking points
- `src/lib/realtime/` — the room channel (Supabase broadcast, BroadcastChannel fallback)
- `src/components/tv/`, `src/components/host/`, `src/components/play/`, `src/components/editor/` — the surfaces
- `src/app/api/nights/` — season nights: open, join (from a player's phone), post results (host only)
- `src/lib/server/` — server-only Supabase access for the leaderboard
- `src/lib/sound.ts` — stings synthesized with Web Audio (no audio files)

## Deploying

Import the repo in Vercel, add the two `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_*` variables (and, for accounts, the Clerk keys and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`) in the project's environment settings, and add your domain under Settings → Domains. Use Clerk production keys there and add the domain in the Clerk dashboard.
